 FIN_strat_bomber_equipment_1_desc:0 "Experiences from the Great War and studies since show that bombing the enemy's military targets and major cities will win the next war. At the very least, we must have a bomber capable of delivering such destruction. It will need to fly high and at good speed, and it must carry a large payload. This will require a large airframe with multiple engines. It will also have some defensive capability."
